Question: When to use LinkedList or ArrayList?

Answer:

Accessing elements are faster with ArrayList, because it is index based.
But accessing is difficult with LinkedList. It is slow access. This is
to access any element, you need to navigate through the elements one by
one. But insertion and deletion is much faster with LinkedList, because
if you know the node, just change the pointers before or after nodes.
Insertion and deletion is slow with ArrayList, this is because, during
these operations ArrayList need to adjust the indexes according to
deletion or insetion if you are performing on middle indexes. Means,
an ArrayList having 10 elements, if you are inserting at index 5, then
you need to shift the indexes above 5 to one more.


map methods

putIfAbsent(key,value) : this method insert key and value if the key is not exist in map 
						 it insert key value pair and return null.
						 If key is exist it returns key.
						 returns-->String value 
						 
Question: What is wrapper class in java?

Answer:

Everything in java is an object, except primitives. Primitives are
int, short, long, boolean, etc. Since they are not objects, they cannot
return as objects, and collection of objects. To support this, java provides
wrapper classes to move primitives to objects. Some of the wrapper classes
are Integer, Long, Boolean, etc.
